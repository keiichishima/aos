# Academic Operating System

## About
We are developing an operating system for practical education.  This
motivation is similar to MINIX, but we do not focus on theories.
Our main objective is to provide knowledges on hardware-related
programming.  This is one of the most difficult and complex parts
when we start the development of operating system from scratch.

## Developer
Hirochika Asai

## Checkpoints
boot_cp0.1: Simple boot example (just printing a welcome message and stop CPU.)
